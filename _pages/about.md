I’m a Senior Researcher at the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), where I teach robots to learn new skills — from virtual simulations to real-world deployment.

My research focuses on reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and dexterous robot manipulation, especially with dual-arm and robotic hand systems. I lead national R&D projects that explore safe, real-time, and versatile autonomous manipulation.

Beyond papers and code, I’m passionate about turning cutting-edge AI into robots that can actually get things done — safely, efficiently, and in ways that make life better.
