title: "Design and RL-Based Control of a Pan-Tilt Laser Pointer"
year: 2018
affiliation: "UST-ETRI"
description: >
  Designed a **pan-tilt laser pointer mechanism** and implemented an **embedded control system** for precise positioning.  
  Developed a **laser pointing control system** using **analytic inverse kinematics (IK)** and **reinforcement learning (RL)**.  
  This system won the **Gold Award (2nd place)** in the Makers category and the **Siemens Special Award** at the **2018 CDE Conference**.
