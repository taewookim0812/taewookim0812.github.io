title: "Analytic Motion Retargeting for Skeleton-to-NAO Mapping"
year: 2019
affiliation: "UST-ETRI"
description: >
  Developed an **analytic motion retargeting system** for real-time control of the NAO robot by mapping **human skeleton data (from Kinect)** to NAOâ€™s kinematic structure.  
  See the `NAO_AMR.py` script in the linked code repository for implementation details.
